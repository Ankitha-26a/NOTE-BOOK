Notesnook
An end-to-end encrypted note taking alternative to Evernote.
Technologies & languages
Notesnook is built using the following technologies:

1.JavaScript/Typescript — this repo is in a hybrid state. A lot of the newer code is being written in Typescript & the old code is slowly being ported over.
2.React — the whole front-end across all platforms is built using React.
3.React Native — For mobile apps we are using React Native
4.Electron — For desktop app
5.NPM — listed here because we don't use Yarn or PNPM or XYZ across any of our projects.
